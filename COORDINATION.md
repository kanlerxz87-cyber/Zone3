### Branch naming decision (logged 2026-11-13, session 7f84fea4)

The brief asks for `session-<id>/<task>` branches. Arena's session branch note fixes this session to one branch, `arena/7f84fea4-zone3`, and forbids creating or pushing other branches. Task IDs (T1–T6) on this board replace the per-task branches. Earlier text on this board said the branch rule came from an "Arena session rule". That was an unsourced claim and is withdrawn. The source is the branch note in the session instructions.

## Integration with session 26634cd5 (PR #1)

`main` moved to 8cc2d4a while this branch was in review. PR #1 had merged the other session's site, which added files with the same names. The merge produced add/add conflicts in 15 files. Stopping on conflicts would have left the branch unmergeable, so the integration was resolved in this branch as follows, and the other session's files were kept, not deleted:

- **Archived, unchanged:** `archive/26634cd5/` holds the other session's scripts, data, pages, CSS, README and COORDINATION.md as they were on `main` at 8cc2d4a, with `ARCHIVE_NOTE.md`. Their original files are also in git history.
- **Kept from this branch:** the generator, checker, page set and data schema. Sources, policy facts and flags were merged into them (below).
- **Old URLs:** `analysis.html` and `categories/home-kitchen-air-fryers.html` now redirect to `executive-summary.html` and `products.html`.
- **Conflict log:** add/add conflicts in COORDINATION.md, README.md, assets/style.css, data/flags.json, data/products.json, data/sources.json, flagged.html, index.html, scripts/build_site.py, scripts/check_site.py, sources.html; auto-merged analysis.html, assets/app.js, categories/home-kitchen-air-fryers.html, data/*.

| S6 (dp for product 3, interstitial) | S16 | Interstitial only |
| — | S23 | Product 3 destination title via the short link |
| S7 (Operating Agreement) | S01 | Section 5 wording |
| S8 (Program Policies) | S02 | |
| S9 (commission schedule, login-gated) | S03 | Not readable |
| S10 (FTC 2019) | S07 | Dated 2019; newer guide mapped to S24 |
| — | S04, S05, S06 | Creators API docs and PA-API 5 deprecation (this branch) |
| — | S08, S09, S10 | amazon.com/dp checks for the three IDs |
| — | S17 (third-party), S18 (not accessible), S19 (footer), S20–S22 (repo and Pages checks) | Not used as facts |
| — | S24 | FTC topic page (current Endorsement Guides, 2023) |

### Flag ID mapping

| Other session (F) | This board (FLG) |
|---|---|
| F1 short-link codes do not match the ASIN | FLG-001 |
| F2 no Associate tag | FLG-010 |
| F3 marketplace and eligibility | FLG-015 |
| F4 price, rating and reviews unverified | FLG-004 |
| F5 Kitchen commission rate unverified | FLG-005 |
| F6 product 3 direct page unverified | FLG-020 (and FLG-002) |
| F7 platform automation not built | FLG-012 (and FLG-019) |
| F8 FTC guidance dated 2019 | FLG-017 |

## Verification performed (7f84fea4)

- Official pages re-read on 2026-11-13, with the text kept in `data/policy_facts.json`:
  - Operating Agreement chunks 0–3 of 4, including Schedule 1 (US only).
  - Program Policies chunks 0–9 of 11 (chunk 10 unread).
  - Creators API GetItems chunks 0–2 of 3. The ASIN is a 10-character identifier. The example ASINs in the sample are in the docs, so they are not product data.
  - FTC topic page (2023 Endorsement Guides revision).
- Product links re-resolved on 2026-11-13: each short link, the plain `amazon.com/dp/<ID>` URL for products 1 and 2, and the product 3 direct URL (interstitial). Titles are recorded as observed; prices and ratings are not present in the text returned.
- Withdrawn: PF-14 (reviews for compensation). Its text was not found in any section read.
- `scripts/check_site.py`: OK, 9 pages, 3 products, 24 sources, 20 flags.
- Limitation: the checker verifies the structure (sources present, links resolve, official hosts, no Python leaks). It does not compare quotes to source text. Quotes were checked by hand against the fetched text, and that is recorded in each fact's `section` field.
- Limitation: the Program Policies chunk 10 and the commission schedule (S03) were not read. Rates are not stated anywhere on the site.
