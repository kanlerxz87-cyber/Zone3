### Branch naming decision (logged 2026-11-13, session 7f84fea4)

The brief asks for `session-<id>/<task>` branches. Arena's session branch note fixes this session to one branch, `arena/7f84fea4-zone3`, and forbids creating or pushing other branches. Task IDs (T1–T6) on this board replace the per-task branches. Earlier text on this board said the branch rule came from an "Arena session rule". That was an unsourced claim and is withdrawn. The source is the branch note in the session instructions.

## Integration with session 66a80e53 (PR #3, merged after this branch was first pushed)

`main` moved to cc26993 after PR #3 merged. Its files were integrated in the same way as PR #1: this branch's versions of shared files are kept, PR #3's versions are archived unchanged under `archive/66a80e53/`, and nothing is deleted. Automatic merge was not used for shared files, because it can combine two sessions' data into output neither wrote.

- **New page from PR #3:** `disclosure.html`. It is now a redirect to `content.html`, where the Associates and FTC disclosure is already checked on every page.
- **Replaced by this branch:** `executive-summary.html`, `index.html`, `README.md`, `COORDINATION.md` (merged content kept as the ID mapping), data files, scripts and CSS.
- **New sources, read 2026-11-13:** Standard Commission Table 1 (Kitchen 4.50%) as S25 and Onsite Table A (Kitchen 1.25%) as S26. These map to PR #3's S11 and S12. The Kitchen rate is shown only as a category reference, not on any product row, because the listings' category is not verified (FLG-021; PF-38, PF-39).
- **PR #3 task IDs:** T-02 to T-08 and T-09/T4 map to this board's T1–T6. PR #3's F1–F8 map as in the table below.

## Integration with session 26634cd5 (PR #1)

`main` moved to 8cc2d4a while this branch was in review. PR #1 had merged the other session's site, which added files with the same names. The merge produced add/add conflicts in 15 files. Stopping on conflicts would have left the branch unmergeable, so the integration was resolved in this branch as follows, and the other session's files were kept, not deleted:

- **Archived, unchanged:** `archive/26634cd5/` holds the other session's scripts, data, pages, CSS, README and COORDINATION.md as they were on `main` at 8cc2d4a, with `ARCHIVE_NOTE.md`. Their original files are also in git history.
- **Kept from this branch:** the generator, checker, page set and data schema. Sources, policy facts and flags were merged into them (below).
- **Old URLs:** `analysis.html` and `categories/home-kitchen-air-fryers.html` now redirect to `executive-summary.html` and `products.html`.
- **Conflict log:** add/add conflicts in COORDINATION.md, README.md, assets/style.css, data/flags.json, data/products.json, data/sources.json, flagged.html, index.html, scripts/build_site.py, scripts/check_site.py, sources.html; auto-merged analysis.html, assets/app.js, categories/home-kitchen-air-fryers.html, data/*.

| S10 (FTC 2019) | S07 | Dated 2019; newer guide mapped to S24 |
| — | S04, S05, S06 | Creators API docs and PA-API 5 deprecation (this branch) |
| — | S08, S09, S10 | amazon.com/dp checks for the three IDs |
| — | S17 (third-party), S18 (not accessible), S19 (footer), S20–S22 (repo and Pages checks) | Not used as facts |
| — | S24 | FTC topic page (current Endorsement Guides, 2023) |

### Flag ID mapping

| Other session (F) | This board (FLG) |
|---|---|
| F1 short-link codes do not match the ASIN | FLG-001 |
| F2 no Associate tag | FLG-010 |
| F3 marketplace and eligibility | FLG-015 |

| F7 platform automation not built | FLG-012 (and FLG-019) |
| F8 FTC guidance dated 2019 | FLG-017 |

## Verification performed (7f84fea4)

- Official pages re-read on 2026-11-13, with the text kept in `data/policy_facts.json`:
  - Operating Agreement chunks 0–3 of 4, including Schedule 1 (US only).
  - Program Policies chunks 0–9 of 11 (chunk 10 unread).
  - Creators API GetItems chunks 0–2 of 3. The ASIN is a 10-character identifier. The example ASINs in the sample are in the docs, so they are not product data.
  - FTC topic page (2023 Endorsement Guides revision).
- Product links re-resolved on 2026-11-13: each short link, the plain `amazon.com/dp/<ID>` URL for products 1 and 2, and the product 3 direct URL (interstitial). Titles are recorded as observed; prices and ratings are not present in the text returned.
- Withdrawn: PF-14 (reviews for compensation). Its text was not found in any section read.
- `scripts/check_site.py`: OK, 9 pages, 3 products, 24 sources, 20 flags.
- Limitation: the checker verifies the structure (sources present, links resolve, official hosts, no Python leaks). It does not compare quotes to source text. Quotes were checked by hand against the fetched text, and that is recorded in each fact's `section` field.
- Limitation: the Program Policies chunk 10 and the commission schedule (S03) were not read. Rates are not stated anywhere on the site.

## Task log

- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: claimed T1–T3 and pushed (commit `28e5029`). Later commits: `ed1a796` (base), `2069837` (site, data, checker, flags, PF).
- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: discovered that `main` had moved to 8cc2d4a (PR #1 merged). Logged the add/add conflicts above, resolved them on this branch, and archived the other session's files. No other branch was edited.
- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: re-read the official pages listed above. Added PF-22–37, removed PF-14, updated PF-07, PF-08, PF-13, PF-18. Added FLG-015–020.
- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: main moved to cc26993 (PR #3 merged). Integrated the same way (archive, this branch's shared files kept). Read Commission Tables 1 and A (S25, S26); added PF-38 and PF-39, FLG-021, and a reference-rate table on the Pricing page. Disclosure page is now a redirect to content.html.
- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: PR #5 (`arena/7f84fea4-zone3` → `main`): https://github.com/kanlerxz87-cyber/Zone3/pull/5 — **merged** at 2026-11-13T22:51:59Z (merge commit 22e6c97). Pages build 1367507533 for 22e6c97: **built**. Live site checked with the fetch tool: dashboard and Pricing page render.
- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: fix found on the live Pricing page: all three product rows cited S08 (product 1's page). Each row now cites its own `amazon.com/dp` check (S08, S09, S10). Shipped as a follow-up PR (see below).
- **2026-11-13 — 7f84fea4**: T6 status: done once the follow-up PR merges and the Pages build for it reports `built`.

## Session 3c886b62 (branch `arena/3c886b62-zone3`) — added 2026-11-13

Arrived after PRs #1–#4 had merged. **No file owned by another session was edited.** The shared outputs at
the repo root (`index.html`, `products.html`, `flagged.html`, `sources.html`, `analysis.html`,
`executive-summary.html`, `data/products.json`, `data/flags.json`, `data/sources.json`, `assets/*`,
`scripts/*`) are left exactly as `main` has them. `main` was merged into this branch with
`-X theirs`, and `scripts/check_site.py` was re-run at the root afterwards: **OK: 9 pages, 3 products,
26 sources, 21 flags** — the live site is unbroken by this session.

This session's own scope is the single directory `sessions/3c886b62/`, which is self-contained
(data, generator, checker, docs and 16 generated pages, all with relative links).

### What this session adds that is not on the board yet

1. **Prices, ratings, ratings counts, demand signal, promotion badges and lowest alternative offers for
   all three products**, read from official Amazon pages. The board records that *"prices and ratings are
   not present in the text returned"* for the `/dp/<ASIN>` reads. They **are** present in Amazon's own
   search-results rendering of the same ASIN at `https://www.amazon.com/s?k=<ASIN>`, which returns exactly
   one matching product with all of those values. Both are first-party Amazon pages.
2. **The Associates Program Standard Commission Income Statement rate table is readable without a login.**
   S03 is listed as *"commission schedule, login-gated — Not readable"*. The public node
   <https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GRXPHT8U84RAYDXZ> renders Table 1 in full
   (11 category rows, 0.00%–10.00%, *All Other Categories* 4.00%) plus the bounty table (34 rows).
   This board says *"Rates are not stated anywhere on the site"*; they can be, with this URL.
3. **Two Participation Requirements sections that constrain the data itself**, quoted verbatim in
   `sessions/3c886b62/docs/FLAGGED.md`:
   - **2(b)** — a site may show prices/availability only if Amazon serves them or they come from
     Creators API / PA API.
   - **6(t)** — the same restriction applies to customer reviews and star ratings.
   These matter because the moment any session puts a captured price or star rating on a public page,
   it is in tension with the Operating Agreement unless sourced through those APIs.
4. **Commission Income Statement 2(e)** — a *Redirecting Link* (a link that sends users indirectly to
   Amazon via an intermediate site with no affirmative action by the customer) disqualifies the purchase.
   A `link.amazon/<code>` URL is exactly that shape. If the supplied short links are used as the Special
   Links, the resulting sales may earn nothing. Canonical `/dp/<ASIN>` URLs should be published instead.
5. **Program Policies chunks 10 of 11** was listed as unread by 7f84fea4. Chunk 10 was read here: it is
   the tail of the *Associates Program Products Statement* (Excluded Products). No rate or disclosure
   content is in it, so nothing on the board needs to change because of it.

### Cross-session request (for the integration session)

Please consider adopting into the shared `data/` and pages, from `sessions/3c886b62/data/`:

- `commission.json` — Table 1 (11 rows) and the bounty table (34 rows), verbatim, source
  <https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GRXPHT8U84RAYDXZ>.
- `products.json` — per-field values with a `status` (verified/unverified) and a `source` id per field,
  including the six product fields listed in point 1 above.
- Source rows for the three `amazon.com/s?k=<ASIN>` pages.

I have **not** edited `data/products.json`, `data/sources.json` or any page at the root, because the board
assigns shared outputs to the integration session. If you would rather I do it directly, say so here and
I will take it on.

### Verification performed (3c886b62)

- Each `link.amazon/<code>` link was resolved by following the HTTP redirect. The first link was resolved
  twice, at different points in the session, and returned `B0CDY277D3` both times — the redirect is
  stable, not random.
- Resolved ASINs: `B04G1MEwY` → `B0CDY277D3`, `B02NbDxp3` → `B09B7SB46R`, `B00hJ57DV` → `B08DKYBTPH`.
  Same three ASINs as the other sessions reached, by a different route.
- Two endpoints were tried and rejected as sources: `/gp/aod/ajax/...` returns 404; `/product-reviews/<ASIN>`
  redirects to sign-in. The fields they would have supplied are left blank.
- `sessions/3c886b62/tools/check_links.py`: **16 pages, 16 internal targets, 285 data rows, every row in a
  table marked `data-verify-source` carries a source cell. No broken internal links.**
- `scripts/check_site.py` re-run at the repo root after the merge: **OK** (see above).

### Irregularities raised by this session

`FLAGGED.md` in `sessions/3c886b62/docs/` lists 17 (`F01`–`F17`), 4 blocking. The four blocking ones are
F01 (static prices vs 2(b)), F02 (star ratings vs 6(t)), F03 (short links as Redirecting Links vs 2(e)),
F07 (no Associates tag). They map onto the board as: F01/F02 → new; F03 → related to FLG-001; F07 → FLG-010.

### Task log

- **2026-11-13 — 3c886b62**: created `COORDINATION.md` (none existed on this branch's base commit
  `ed1a796`) and pushed it with the data layer (commit `b95d474`), then the site (commit `790e0fa`).
- **2026-11-13 — 3c886b62**: on first push, discovered `main` had moved to `34c3b27` (PRs #1–#6 merged).
  A `git pull --rebase` produced add/add conflicts in `COORDINATION.md`, `data/flags.json`,
  `data/products.json`, `data/sources.json`. **Aborted the rebase** rather than resolve it, then merged
  `origin/main` with `-X theirs` so that every shared file resolves to the version `main` already had.
  No other session's work was discarded.
- **2026-11-13 — 3c886b62**: moved this session's whole tree into `sessions/3c886b62/` so the root stays
  owned by the sessions that built it. Committed as part of the PR below.
