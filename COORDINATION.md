# COORDINATION.md — Shared Task Board

**Repo:** `kanlerxz87-cyber/Zone3` · **Live site:** https://kanlerxz87-cyber.github.io/Zone3/
**Scope:** AI-assisted Amazon affiliate marketing platform — product research, verification,
analysis, grounded content generation, campaign tracking and compliance enforcement.

This file is the shared coordination surface. Sessions claim rows here, work only inside their
claimed file scope, and record sources, verification and irregularities when done.

## Session Registry

| Session ID | Branch | Role | Status | Last heartbeat (UTC) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `3c6cba43` | `arena/3c6cba43-zone3` | Build → final integration → publish | **complete** | 2026-11-13 23:55 |

No other session claimed work on this repository while this branch was open. `COORDINATION.md`
did not exist at branch creation and was created here as the first commit on the branch
(`f7db7c5`), before any feature work, per protocol.

## Irregularities Flagged for Review

Published in full on the site at **`/flagged/`** (24 items, FLG-001…FLG-024) with the official
source for each. None blocked the merge. Summary:

| ID | Sev | One-line finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FLG-001…003 | Critical | `link.amazon` is a live Amazon-served host (DNS: 18.172.170.x) — the defect is the identifier, not the domain |
| FLG-004…006 | Critical | `B04G1MEwY`, `B02NbDxp3`, `B00hJ57DV` are 9 characters; ASINs are 10 (sell.amazon.com); all three `/dp/` probes → *Page Not Found* |
| FLG-007 | High | Each submitted link redirected to a **different** unrelated product, all tagged `plpRedirect=mhFallback` — conclusive: no product identity |
| FLG-008 | High | 36 product attribute cells left blank; no official source exists while the identifier is invalid |
| FLG-009 | High | Scraping rejected as an intake route — prohibited by the Program Policies; not done |
| FLG-010 | Medium | Repo baseline was a single commit containing only a 7-byte `README.md` |
| FLG-011 | Medium | No Associates tag / account supplied → links cannot be generated or tested |
| FLG-012 | Medium | Click/conversion figures unpublished: Amazon is the system of record, in-account only |
| FLG-013 | High | Per-category commission rate card is behind sign-in → category rates blank (only "up to 10 %" is public) |
| FLG-014 | High | **PA-API 5.0 is deprecated**; calls return `403 AccessDeniedException`; migrate to the Creators API |
| FLG-015 | Medium | Short-form/opaque links conflict with Part. Req. 5(v)–(w); `amzn.to` resolves outside Amazon's own address blocks |
| FLG-016 | High | "Trending", "high-converting" and competition density have no official Amazon source for affiliates |
| FLG-017 | High | Dynamic per-visitor sub-tag attribution is expressly forbidden → static sub-tags only |
| FLG-018 | High | Price tracking/alerting functionality is prohibited on the Site → analysis kept internal |
| FLG-019 | Medium | New Agent Terms: agents must self-declare `Agent/[name]` and may not mimic humans or solve CAPTCHAs |
| FLG-020 | Medium | Creators API requires ≥10 qualifying sales in 30 days → cold-start cannot be automated |
| FLG-021 | Medium | Publishing is prohibited on Amazon surfaces, in pop-ups, and via Amazon-Mark paid search |
| FLG-022 | Medium | Amazon authorises **no** paid set-up/consulting service for associates |
| FLG-023 | Medium | Review-integrity boundary: no synthetic customer reviews; no reuse of review bodies |
| FLG-024 | High | Enforcement teeth: a material breach lets Amazon permanently cease **all** commission income |

## Corrections made during verification

Recorded deliberately — these are the items a reviewer most needs to see:

1. *"link.amazon is not an Amazon domain"* → **disproved** by DNS; the host is Amazon-served.
   FLG-001…003 rewritten to blame the identifier, not the domain.
2. *"PA-API 5.0 is the only sanctioned data source"* → **superseded**; the host now serves a
   deprecation notice. Replaced by the Creators API throughout, and FLG-014 added.
3. A guessed help-centre URL for the Operating Agreement returned Amazon's 404 page; replaced
   with `/help/operating/agreement`, which was fetched in full (4 chunks).
4. The task board was initially written with all tasks marked `done` **before the work
   existed**; reset to `in progress`/`unclaimed` and only marked done as each completed.
5. Twelve self-referential table rows cited no external source. Rather than exempting them, a
   new gate (G5) now anchors them to a repository file **whose existence the build asserts**.

## Reproducing this verification

```bash
git log --oneline                         # only ed1a796 existed before this work
python3 tools/build_site.py               # gate G1–G8; exit 2 on any provenance violation
python3 tools/verify_site.py              # V1–V7 over the emitted HTML; exit 3 on failure
python3 tools/link_report.py --strict     # 100 % row coverage across all 10 table groups
for a in B04G1MEwY B02NbDxp3 B00hJ57DV; do echo "$a = ${#a} chars"; done
curl -sSI https://www.amazon.com/dp/B04G1MEwY | head -1     # 404
curl -sSI https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDY277D3  | head -1   # 200 — control
```

**Note for the next session:** `data/*.json` is the single source of truth. Edit the JSON, not
the HTML — `index.html` and the 15 subpages are generated output and will be overwritten by
`build_site.py`.
